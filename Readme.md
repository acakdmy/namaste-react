#  What is `NPM`?

* This is for reference :- https://docs.npmjs.com/

npm is the world's largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

npm consists of three distinct components:

the website
the Command Line Interface (CLI)
the registry
Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up organizations to manage access to public or private packages.

The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.

* Use npm to . . .
1) Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
2)Download standalone tools you can use right away.
3)Run packages without downloading using npx.
4)Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
5)Restrict code to specific developers.
6)Create organizations to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
7)Form virtual teams by using organizations.
8)Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
9)Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
10)Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
11)Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.

# What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?

A module bundler is a tool that takes pieces of JavaScript and their dependencies and bundles them into a single file, usually for use in the browser. You may have used tools such as Browserify, Webpack, Rollup or one of many others.

* Parcel is a web application bundler, differentiated by its developer experience. It offers blazing fast performance utilizing multicore processing, and requires zero configuration.

// yarn global add parcel-bundler

* Many front-end developers have become frustrated with some of the complexities involved with building web apps today. Itâ€™s pretty standard practice to include some kind of build or bundling tool in a front-end workflow, thus many developers have looked into using a front-end tool like webpack/Rollup/Parcel.
